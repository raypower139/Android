# Hillfort Assignment For College

This is a college assignment where we had to develop a Kotlin based Android App for Hillforts. Users can log into the App which is preloaded with Hillforts they are suggested to visit. The user can add photo's, the date visited, description, location using google maps and notes on each hillfort. They can also add their own hillforts and also view a settings page where they can update thier details and view some simple stats.
